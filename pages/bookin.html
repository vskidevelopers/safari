          the company knowledge, correct at the time of going to press but the
          company reserves the right to change the same. The photographs
          reproduced and information provided in this brochure/web site, depict
          typical scenes experienced and details on each destination; but the
          subject or scene may not necessarily be seen or experienced while
          visiting the destination.
        </p>
        <h2>TERMS and CONDITIONS.</h2>
        <p>
          * These terms and conditions govern the relationship between the
          company and you (the client), to the total exclusion of any other
          terms and conditions. No alterations to the terms and conditions may
          be made by any of the company employees, authorized representative or
          agents unless in writing by the managing director of the company or
          the company official spokesman. All decisions and matters are subject
          to the company discretion.
        </p>
        <p>FLEXIBILITY.</p>
        <p>
          * The client appreciates and acknowledges that the nature of this type
          of travel requires considerable flexibility and should allow for
          alternatives. The outline itinerary as given for each tour must
          therefore be taken as an indication of what each tour/group may
          accomplish and not as a contractual obligation on the part of the
          company. It is understood that the route, schedules, itineraries,
          amenities and mode of transport may be subject to alteration without
          prior notice due to local circumstances or events, which may include
          sickness or mechanical breakdown, flight, strikes, cancellations,
          events emanating from political disputes, entry or boarder
          difficulties, climate and other unpredictable or unforeseeable
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF RISK.</h2>
        <p>
          * The client acknowledges that the nature of the tour is expeditionary
          and adventurous and that such holidays may involve a significant
          amount of personal risk. Such risks include injury, disease, loss or
          damage to property, discomfort and inconvenience. In particular the
          client acknowledges that travelling in vehicles fitted with a roof
          seat or travelling in any position other than seated in the seats
          provided inside the vehicle is entirely at the clients own risk.
        </p>
        <h2>AUTHORITY ON TOURS.</h2>
        <p>
          * At all times the decision of the company tour leader or
          representative will be final on all matters likely to endanger the
          safety and the smooth running continuation of the tour. The client
          must at all times strictly comply with the laws, customs, foreign
          exchange and drug regulations of all countries visited. Should the
          client fail to comply with the above, or should the client interfere
          with the well being of the group then the tour leader or company
          representative may order the client to leave the tour without recourse
          to any refund.
        </p>
        <h2>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.</h2>
        <p>
          * The client must be in possession of a valid travel document and all
          visas, permits and certificates, required for the whole journey and
          the client accepts responsibility for obtaining the same. Any
          information or advice given by the company on visas, vaccinations,
          climate, clothing, baggage, special equipment, etc. is given in good
          faith but without responsibility on the part of the company.
        </p>
        <h2>FORCE MAJEURE.</h2>
        <p>
          * Factors outside the company control (Force Majeure). The company
          will do its best to minimize the effects of matters outside its
          control but cannot accept any liability for these matters which
          include political disputes, boarder closures, refusal of visas,
          industrial action, delayed flights, unforeseeable climate, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Clients responsibility for personal travels insurance. The client is
          willing to accept full responsibility for insurance up to limits that
          the clients may require. This insurance must cover personal accident,
          medical expenses, air ambulance, loss of personal effects,
          repatriation costs, and all other expenses which might arise as a
          result of loss, damage, injury, delay or inconvenience occurring to
          the client. It is compulsory that all clients have personal travel
          insurance. This policy must include the minimum costs of medical and
          repatriation expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Clients responsibility for effecting other insurance. The client is
          strongly advised to take out cancellation and curtailment insurance.
          The client acknowledges that insurance provision in respect of spouse
          and any other dependents is an important matter for which the client
          accepts full responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Claims and complaints. If a client has a complaint against the
          company the client must first inform the tour leader or company
          representative whilst on tour in order that the tour leader or
          representative can attempt to rectify the matter. Any further
          complaint must be put in writing to the company within thirty days
          after the tour ending.
